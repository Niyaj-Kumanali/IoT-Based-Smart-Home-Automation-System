<h2> Project Name :</h2>
<h1 align = 'center'>IoT Based Smart Home Automation System</br></h1>
</br>

<h2>Introduction :</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>There is an increasing demand for smart homes, where appliances react automatically to changing environmental conditions and can be easily controlled through one common device.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>This project presents a possible solution where by the user controls devices by using their existing mobile phone ,where control is communicated to the Microcontroller from a mobile phone through its wifi interface.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Home Automation? </h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Home automation involves introducing a degree of computerized or automatic control to certain electrical and electronics system in a building.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>These lighting, temperature control, etc.., this paper demonstrate a simple home automation system which contains a remote mobile host controller and several client module(home appliances).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The client modules communicate with host controllers through a wireless device such as a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone, in this case, an android based smart phone.</p>
    </li>
    
</ul>

<h2>Hardware and software Requirements :</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hardware :</li>
    <ul>
        <li>NodeMCU8266</li>
        <li>4 Channel Relay</li>
        <li>Two way switches</li>
        <li>5V Adapter</li>
        <li>Jumper wires</li>
        <li>Connecting wires</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Software :</li>
    <ul>
        <li>IFTTT</li>
        <li>Blynk App</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Working :</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>The load can be controlled and monitored using a application. The user can send commands through the allotted IP and these commands fed to Wi-Fi module. The Wi-Fi module is configured to access internet using provided wireless modem. The commands received by a Wi-Fi module are executed by a program within a Wi-Fi module. The Wi-Fi module is interfaced to Octocoupler through the loads are turned ON and OFF based on commands. The loads status (ON or OFF) will be displayed on the application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Also it can be controlled by setting a timer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>In a same we can control this by a two way switch and also by a google assistant. If we say "hey google turn ON reley 1"this commend go to blynk app through IFTTT website and relay 1 will turned ON. It also works for turning OFF of relay 1.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion :</h2>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Home automation is connecting all the functional elements of your home to a network (Internet) and putting it to work for you. From lighting to air-conditioning, from television to door-locks, you can now control, monitor and track your home from anywhere in the world, using your smartphone, computer or tablet device.</p>
